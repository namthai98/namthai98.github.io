## Become a software engineer


After graduating from university, I had the opportunity to work in a large company in Japan and become a hardware engineer. 
But after nearly 2 years working there, I realize that this job didn't suitable with me and I will not be successfull if I develop my career 
as hardware engineer.

With the suggestion and guidance from my friend, I decided to leave the company and start my career path and become a software engineer.
